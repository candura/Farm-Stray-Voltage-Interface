Channel Calibration:

If the Stray Voltage Interface was calibrated with a PowerPro then these values will all be 1 when it is used with the specific PowerPro that it was calibrated with. If the Stray Voltage Interface was characterized without a PowerPro then these values should be set to the values that are on the Stray Voltage Interface calibration sticker.


Service Type:

Select either single phase or three phase. This will affect the report configuration.


Vcc Input:
